This is a very early build of a App built for an NBA team, for coaches to use on the court. I am unable to post the finished version, due to being asked not to.

The basic info I can provide is this allows a coach to put in up to 5 players at a time and save the times each player is out on the court(In play). I've added extra functionality to show basic information of the opposing team, as well as who is injured/suspended.
